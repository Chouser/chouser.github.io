<h1><code>apply concat</code> <em>and friends</em></h1>


<p>The other day at work, writing a function, I typed <code>mapcat
seq</code>...</p>

<table class="dialog">
<tr><td><b>Me: </b></td><td>Hey, are you familiar with this?</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Pairing partner: </b></td><td>Nope</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Me: </b></td><td>Ah, well <code>(mapcat seq xs)</code> is just like <code>(apply concat xs)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Pairing partner: </b></td><td>Oh, so why not just use <code>(apply concat xs)</code>?</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Me: </b></td><td>...</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The first I heard of <code>mapcat seq</code> was when Christophe Grand
mentioned it some years ago. I'm not sure what he found pleasant about it, but
<i>I</i> love that it's shorter than <code>apply concat</code> (by two
characters!) and I've used it ever since.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just realized that (mapcat seq x) is a pleasant alternative to (apply concat x). <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/clojure?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#clojure</a></p>&mdash; Christophe Grand (@cgrand) <a href="https://twitter.com/cgrand/status/243793887532052480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>Two characters is of course a silly reason to choose one over the other, in
all but the most <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4clojure</a> of
circumstances. But they are very similar and there are other alternatives, so
which is best? I decided to carefully study this question by conducting a
rigorously controlled and scientific Twitter poll. Twenty-four hours later I had
my answer:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just because they do different things doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have a favorite.</p>&mdash; Chouser (@chrishouser) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishouser/status/1118913793512411136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2019</a><br>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I wasn't really expecting everyone to pick my favorite. More respondents
liked <code>apply concat</code>, and I can live with that. Maybe I should
conform for the sake of community. But what I can't abide is that it only barely
beat out <code>flatten</code>! Unacceptable! I had no choice to but to
immediately dawdle, procrastinate, and finally five months later write a blog
post about it.</p>

<h2>The infamous <code>flatten</code></h2>

<p>The other three options in the poll are indeed very similar. In fact their
differences are so subtle, I really doubt you will ever regret whichever one use
choose to use. I dare not, however, make this same prediction about
<code>flatten</code>, for I fear if you use it in innocence it will betray
you.</p>

<p>To explain why, let's first look at an example for which all four
expressions return the same value:</p>

<pre>
(flatten [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]])
;=&gt; (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
</pre>

<p>When you reach for any of these expressions, this is usually what you're
thinking of: take a sequence of sequences and stitch them together into a single
sequence. And <code>flatten</code> indeed does this, but it does a lot more.
Let's examine its definition:</p>

<pre>
(defn flatten
  "Takes any nested combination of sequential things (lists, vectors,
  etc.) and returns their contents as a single, flat lazy sequence.
  (flatten nil) returns an empty sequence."
  {:added "1.2"
   :static true}
  [x]
  (filter (complement sequential?)
          (rest (tree-seq sequential? seq x))))
</pre>

<figure style="float: right; width: 211px;">
<img alt="Flattened cat. Looks surprised."
  src="flatten.svg" onerror="this.src='flatten.jpg'"
  style="width: 211px; height: 213px;">
<figcaption>
  <b><code>flatten</code> – </b>Looks surprised. You will be too.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First, note the use of <code>tree-seq</code>, an amazingly powerful little
function that can return a lazy sequence of a depth-first walk of any kind of
tree. Its use (and the mention of "nested" in the docstring) suggest
<code>flatten</code> is treating its input as a tree, not just a sequence of
sequences. So whereas <code>apply concat</code> and <code>mapcat seq</code>
<i>assume</i> their input is a sequence of seqables and stop there,
<code>flatten</code> examines each element and may choose to descend deeper into
the input, examining as it goes.</p>

<p>Second, note that it uses <code>sequential?</code>, an infrequently used
predicate in my experience, to choose when to descend. Would it surprise you to
learn that persistent queues are <code>sequential?</code>, but strings, sets,
and arrays are not? How confident are you that future maintainers of your code
know this?</p>

<p>With this knowledge we can construct a couple examples where
<code>flatten</code> behaves differently from the alternatives in the poll.</p>

<table class="examples">
  <tr>
    <th><i>input</i></th>
    <th><code>flatten</code></th>
    <th><code>apply concat</code> and others</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[[1 2 3] 4 [5 6]]</code></td>
    <td><code>(1 2 3 4 5 6)</code></td>
    <td><i>error</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[[1 [2 3]] [4 5 6]]</code></td>
    <td><code>(1 2 3 4 5 6)</code></td>
    <td><code>(1 [2 3] 4 5 6)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[[1 2 3] #{4 5 6}]</code></td>
    <td><code>(1 2 3 #{4 6 5})</code></td>
    <td><code>(1 2 3 4 6 5)</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So beware, <code>flatten</code> is different and more complicated than the
alternatives. Only rarely do I have multiple levels of nested sequences that I
want to flatten, where <code>sequential?</code> correctly defines when I want
it to descend. I'm not alone in warning about its use. <a
href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2012-05-01.html#19:34">Others</a> <a

and Eric Normand wrote up a <a
href="https://purelyfunctional.tv/issues/purelyfunctional-tv-newsletter-322-tip-avoid-flatten-when-possible/">nice
example</a> of how it can betray you.</p> </p>

<p>Now if we've ruled out <code>flatten</code> for most common use cases, what
shall we use instead?</p>

<h2>Enumerating alternatives</h2>

<p>I didn't put a lot of thought into the choices to give in the Twitter poll,
so if we want to find the best alternative, perhaps a more rigorous approach to
finding alternatives is warranted. There are a couple projects to help find all
Clojure functions that behave in a particular way: Michiel Borkent's somewhat
confusingly named <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/re-find">re-find</a>
which leverages the declared specs of functions (via <code>core.spec</code>) to
find matches, and Anthony Grimes's <a
href="https://github.com/Raynes/findfn">findfn</a> which tries calling all the
functions and macros in a namespace to see which produces the desired results.
Neither quite meets our requirements here because besides finding
single-function solutions like <code>flatten</code>, we also want higher-order
solutions like <code>apply concat</code>.</p>

<p>So I wrote a function to specifically look for expressions of the form
<code>(f1 f2 xs)</code> for any <i>f1</i> and <i>f2</i> that return the same
value as <code>(mapcat seq xs)</code>.</p>

<pre>
(defn find-phrases []
  (let [xs [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]]
        goal (mapcat seq xs)
        vars (vals (ns-publics 'clojure.core))]

    (doall
     (for [v0 vars
           v1 vars
           :when (try
                    (= goal (@v0 @v1 xs))
                    (catch Throwable t false))]
       (list v0 v1 'xs)))))
</pre>

<p>I don't recommend you run this since it freezes, crashes, and breaks in
various ways. You may be surprised to find that some combinations of core
functions are not well-behaved. But it almost works: <code>vars</code> is a
sequence of all public vars in <code>clojure.core</code>, the <code>for</code>
builds all pairs, and the <code>:when</code> clause tries the pair and compares
against our <code>goal</code>.</p>

<img alt="A very lazy cat, curled up, asleep, with a treasure map on its side"

  style="width: 240px; height: 156px;">
<figcaption>
  <b><code>mapcat identity</code> – </b>A close cousin to <code>mapcat
  seq</code>, but lazier.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All that's left is to make it not fall apart, so I added a try/catch around
the scary test invocation. This wasn't enough, so I also manually excluded
several functions and a couple of combinations that caused problems and won't
meet the goal. <a
href="https://github.com/Chouser/apply-concat-and-friends/blob/92eed8373f1da50050a183d90c558833205791f9/src/chouser/mapcatseq.clj#L9-L18">This
version</a> runs to completion in about 11 seconds and finds 44 equivalent
function combinations for the tested input. Most of these use
<code>mapcat</code>, since it turns out there are lots of functions that act
like <code>identity</code> in limited circumstances, for example <code>mapcat
sort</code>. But there are a few others, that look interesting: <code>reduce
into</code>, <code>sequence cat</code>, and <code>eduction cat</code>.</p>

<h2>The eagerness of <code>reduce into</code></h2>

<figure style="float: right; width: 71px">
<img alt="A much smaller cat, looking somewhat startled."
  src="reduce-into.svg" onerror="this.src='reduce-into.jpg'"
  style="width: 71px; height: 68px">
<figcaption>
  <b><code>reduce into</code> – </b> This cat has been reduced.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most of the options mentioned above produce lazy sequences and are more or
less lazy themselves, but not <code>reduce into</code>. When <code>reduce</code>
is called without an <i>init</i> value it uses the first collection element
instead, and since <code>into</code> eagerly pours its second argument into its
first, the return value of <code>reduce into</code> is both fully eager and very
dependant on the type of the first collection element.</p>

<p>The examples in the table below demonstrate that while providing a initial
vector will result in value similar to other alternatives (though as a vector
instead of a sequence), with an initial list the remaining elements will be
reversed, and with an initial set the resulting collection is a set instead of a
sequence with a few elements in indeterminate order.</p>

<table class="examples">
  <tr>
    <th><i>input</i></th>
    <th><code>reduce into</code></th>
    <th><code>apply concat</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[ <b>[</b>1 2 3<b>]</b> [4 5 6]]</code></td>
    <td><code><b>[</b>1 2 3 4 5 6<b>]</b></code></td>
    <td><code><b>(</b>1 2 3 4 5 6<b>)</b></code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[<b>'(</b>1 2 3<b>)</b> [4 5 6]]</code></td>
    <td><code>(<b>6 5 4</b> 1 2 3)</code></td>
    <td><code>(1 2 3 <b>4 5 6</b>)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[<b>#{</b>1 2 3<b>}</b> [4 5 6]]</code></td>
    <td><code><b>#{</b>1 4 6 3 2 5<b>}</b></code></td>
    <td><code>(<b>1 3 2</b> 4 5 6)</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So that's <code>reduce into</code>. The other interesting combinations found both use <code>cat</code>.

<h2>The <code>eduction</code> and <code>sequence</code> of <code>cat</code></h2>

<figure style="float: right; width: 259px">
<img alt="A sequence of three eager cats"
  src="sequence-cat.svg" onerror="this.src='sequence-cat.jpg'"
  style="width: 259px; height: 159px">
<figcaption>
  <b><code>sequence cat</code> – </b> Looks like a sequence of cats, but is actually a concatenation of sequences.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I wasn't familiar with the function <code>cat</code> until
<code>find-phrases</code> found it.  Its docstring says it is a <em>transducer
which concatenates the contents of each input, which must be a collection, into
the reduction.</em>. The concatenation sounds exactly like what we need, so then
it's just a matter of finding something to collect the transducer into a
sequence. I would normally just <code>(into [] cat xs)</code>, but apparently if
I was more familiar with the transducer-related functions, I would have known
about <code>eduction</code> and <code>sequence</code>. Judging by their
docstrings, a key difference between them is that <code>sequence</code> can take
multiple collections and up to one transducer whereas <code>eduction</code> can
take multiple transducers and one collection. But since we only have one of
each, either <code>(eduction cat xs)</code> or <code>(sequence cat xs)</code>
will work.</p>

<p>Several of the <code>apply concat</code> alternatives we've found are so
far indistinguishable from each other. Although <code>flatten</code> and
<code>reduce into</code> behave differently, the rest return apparently
identical lazy sequences, so how shall we decide which to use? One obvious
metric would be speed, but micro-benchmarks are difficult and of questionable
value. So why don't we look at something a bit more concrete: laziness.</p>

<h2>Tools for exploring laziness</h2>

<p>The laziness of a sequence is usually a bit tricky to observe. The easiest
approach is through side effects triggered as the sequence is realized, for
example <code>(map prn [1 2 3])</code> which returns a sequence of
<code>nil</code>s but prints each number as it is forced. This is sometimes
sufficient, but the input sequences we're dealing with here are nested, which
would print confusingly intermingled elements, so let's build a couple of tools
to make laziness easier to see.</p>

<p>Clojure's built-in printer (the <i>P</i> in <i>REPL</i>) forces lazy seqs.
But since the REPL printer, as well as <code>prn</code> and <code>pr-str</code>,
delegate to the <code>print-method</code> multimethod, we can replace the
implementation for <code>ISeq</code> with one that doesn't force lazy seqs. This
is the first tool we'll need.</p>

<pre>
(def ^:dynamic *hold-the-lazy* false)

(defn write-lazy-seq [space? coll w]
  (if (and *hold-the-lazy*
           (instance? clojure.lang.IPending coll)
           (not (realized? coll)))
    (.write w (str (when space? " ") "..."))
    (when (seq coll)
      (when space?
        (.write w " "))
      (.write w (pr-str (first coll)))
      (write-lazy-seq true (rest coll) w))))

(defmethod print-method clojure.lang.ISeq [coll w]
  (.write w "(")
  (write-lazy-seq false coll w)
  (.write w ")"))
</pre>

<p>By default, lazy seqs will print the same as usual:</p>

<pre>
(let [xs (map inc (range 10))]
  (prn xs))
</pre>
<pre class="prn">(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)</pre>

<p>But by binding <code>*hold-the-lazy*</code> while printing, we can now see
where there are unrealized values:</p>

<pre>
(let [xs (map inc (range 50))]
  (binding [*hold-the-lazy* true]
    (prn xs)))
</pre>
<pre class="prn">(...)</pre>

<p>Or we can rebind the root value to change the default behavior:</p>

<pre>
(alter-var-root #'chouser.mapcatseq/*hold-the-lazy* (constantly true))
(map inc (range 50))
</pre>
<pre class="prn">(...)</pre>

<p>Calling <code>first</code> on the sequence forces the <code>map</code>
function consume some of the <i>range</i> in order to compute the first
<i>inc</i>. But how much computation does it actually do?</p>

<pre>
(let [xs (map inc (range 50))]
  (first xs)
  xs)
</pre>
<pre class="prn">
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 ...)</pre>
</pre>

<p>Note that the <i>realization</i> of the values is a side-effect of calling
<code>(first xs)</code>, which is why we can discard that expression's return
value and instead print the original <code>xs</code> sequence afterward.</p>

<p>Another detail to notice is that when <code>map</code> is asked to compute
the first value, it actually computes the first 32 values, a feature called
<i>chunking</i> that is meant to amortize the overhead of creating the new lazy
sequence. But if we want to understand precisely how lazy our various
expressions are, we're going to need something that doesn't chunk. Fortunately,
section 15.3.1 of <i>Joy of Clojure</i> has just the function we need:</p>

<pre>
(defn seq1 [s]
  (lazy-seq
   (when-let [[x] (seq s)]
     (cons x (seq1 (rest s))))))
</pre>

<p>This takes any seqable collection and returns an unchunked lazy seq of it:</p>

<pre>
(let [xs (seq1 (range 50))]
  (first xs)
  xs)
</pre>
<pre class="prn">(0 ...)</pre>

<p>This time, calling <code>first</code> only forces the first element, so only
<code>0</code> is printed before the ellipses.</p>

<p>With these tool in our belt, we're ready to see what just how lazy our
various flatteners are.</p>

<h2>Multidimensional laziness</h2>

<p>Most valid inputs to <code>apply concat</code> and friends are themselves at
least two-dimensional.  For example, here is valid input sequence of length four
(the first dimension), each element of which is a sequence of length three (the
second dimension), using <code>seq1</code> to make it fully lazy:</p>

<pre>
(seq1 [(seq1 [1 2 3])
       (seq1 [4 5 6])
       (seq1 [7 8 9])
       (seq1 [10 11 12])])
</pre>

<p>Using the lazy printer, we can pass this collection to each of expressions
we've been examining to see how much of this input is forced by merely
<i>evaluating</i> the expression, without forcing any part of the returned lazy
sequence. This is enough to start seeing some differenced between these
expressions:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><i>forced</i></td> <td>((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12))</td></tr>
<tr><td>flatten</td> <td>((...) (...) (...) (...) ...)</td></tr>
<tr><td>apply concat</td> <td>((...) (...) (...) (...) ...)</td></tr>
<tr><td>mapcat identity</td> <td>((...) (...) (...) (...) ...)</td></tr>
<tr><td>mapcat seq</td> <td>((1 ...) (4 ...) (7 ...) (10 ...) ...)</td></tr>
<tr><td>reduce into</td> <td>((1 ...) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12))</td></tr>
<tr><td>sequence cat</td> <td>((1 2 3) ...)</td></tr>
<tr><td>eduction cat</td> <td>(...)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Here we can see that <code>eduction cat</code> is the laziest of these,
apparently not even examining its argument. Unsurprisingly, <code>mapcat
identity</code> and <code>mapcat seq</code> are similar, realizing the first 4
elements of the outer sequence, differing only in that <code>seq</code> realizes
the first element of each of those (the 1, 4, 7, and 10).  However it's
interesting to note those four realized top-level elements are shared with
<code>apply concat</code> as well as <code>flatten</code>. So what do these have
in common?</p>

<p>To answer this, let's peek at the implementation of <code>mapcat</code>:</p>

<pre>
(defn mapcat
  ;; ... elided for clarity ...
  ([f & colls]
     (<b>apply concat</b> (apply map f colls))))
</pre>

<p>When I first noticed this, I was a bit stunned. My favorite contender,
<code>mapcat seq</code>, is built on the poll winner, <code>apply concat</code>.
...and of course that's why their laziness profile is similar.  So what about
<code>flatten</code>, why does it fit the same pattern? We looked at it earlier,
and it doesn't use <code>apply</code>. It does, however, call <code>tree-seq</code>:</p>

<pre>
(defn tree-seq
   ;; ... elided for clarity ...
   [branch? children root]
   (let [walk (fn walk [node]
                (lazy-seq
                 (cons node
                  (when (branch? node)
                    (<b>mapcat</b> walk (children node))))))]
     (walk root)))
</pre>

<figure style="float: right; width: 157px">
<img alt="A happy cat with sleepy eyes."
  src="apply-concat.svg" onerror="this.src='apply-concat.jpg'"
  style="width: 157px; height: 152px; float: right; background: #fff">
<figcaption>
  <b><code>apply concat</code> – </b> Winner of the Twitter poll. Somewhat lazy. Somewhat smug.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And there it is, a use of <code>mapcat</code> which in turn calls <code>apply
concat</code> and gives us our four realized elements of the top-level
collection. It turns out <code>apply concat</code> is much more fundamental than
I realized. My allegiance to <code>mapcat seq</code> is wavering.</p>

<p>So now we've seen how of the input is forced by an expression when it is
first evaluated, but another dimension to examine is <i>time</i>. That is, what
happens when we start to realize parts of the <i>return value</i> of the
expressions in question.  Here's a chart using the same input collection, but
showing the state of its laziness after calling <code>first</code> on the
result:</p>

<table>
<tr><td></td><td><i>forced</i></td> <td>((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12))</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td><img alt="" src="flatten.svg" style="width: 21px; height: 21px"></td>
  <td>flatten</td> <td>((1 2 3) (...) (...) (...) ...)</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td><img alt="" src="apply-concat.svg" style="width: 15px; height: 15px"></td>
  <td>apply concat</td> <td>((1 ...) (...) (...) (...) ...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img alt="" src="mapcat-identity.svg" style="width: 24px; height: 15px;"></td>
  <td>mapcat identity</td> <td>((1 ...) (...) (...) (...) ...)</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td><img alt="" src="mapcat-seq.svg" style="width: 28px; height: 13px"></td>
  <td>mapcat seq</td> <td>((1 ...) (4 ...) (7 ...) (10 ...) ...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img alt="" src="reduce-into.svg" style="width: 7px; height: 7px"></td>
  <td>reduce into</td> <td>((1 ...) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img alt="" src="sequence-cat.svg" style="width: 26px; height: 16px"></td>
  <td>sequence cat</td> <td>((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12))</td>
</tr>
<tr><td></td><td>eduction cat</td> <td>((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12))</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now we can see in <code>sequence cat</code> and <code>eduction cat</code>
the eagerness common in transducers; once forced to do some work, they do all of it. The <code>apply concat</code>-based expressions stay relatively lazy, though we can see in the <code>seq</code> in <code>mapcat seq</code> forcing the first element of each sub-collection.</p>

<h2>Answering the question</h2>

<p>In an attempt to answer my pairing partner's straightforward question, I
learned several things: I learned <code>flatten</code> is more popular than it
should be. I learned <code>eduction</code> and <code>sequence</code> are handy
for applying transformers.  And I learned that not only is <code>apply
concat</code> more popular than <code>mapcat seq</code>, it is also more
fundamental.</p>

<tr><td><b>Pairing partner: </b></td><td>Oh, so why not just use <code>(apply concat xs)</code>?</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Me: </b></td><td>...<br>uh, no good reason.</td></tr>

    about trusting the laziness of <code>apply concat</code> and
    <code>mapcat</code>, and suggests the use of <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/medley/blob/ca04c75b70c3c0f1c6d9887087bc3e88eb0414f6/src/medley/core.cljc#L205"><code>medley.core/join</code></a>
    instead.
  <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/pjstadig/status/1176984046477426688">Paul
      Stadig</a> sometimes likes <code>(for [ys xs y ys] y)</code>, a solution
    I completely missed and which, depending on how you count, could also shorter
    than <code>apply concat</code>.
  <li> Stuart Sierra <a href="https://stuartsierra.com/2019/09/25/sequences-in-flatland">has some thoughts</a>. It's like a little blogosphere!
  <li> Also, I fixed a bunch of typos, spelling errors, and the publish date.

<p>I wrote <a
href="https://github.com/Chouser/apply-concat-and-friends/blob/master/src/chouser/mapcatseq.clj">some
code</a> to help explore this space. It's a bit of a mess but includes some
generative tests I didn't use in the text and defines <code>lazier-mapcat</code>
the laziest friend of all.</p> <p>Thanks to Anna Houser for illustrating
<i>apply concat</i> and all her friends.</p> <p>—Chouser, 25 Sept 2019</p> </footer>

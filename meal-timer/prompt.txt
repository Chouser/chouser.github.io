I need a single-page offline web app to help with cooking a meal. Specifically I'd like it to allow a user to easily enter a wall-clock time when the meal must be ready, and then a list of events (e.g. "put potatoes in the oven", or "start oven pre-heating") each with a duration relative to some other event (e.g. "start oven per-heating" should be 5 minutes before "put potatoes in the over"). Of course an event can have its duration relative to the final "meal complete" wall-clock time.

I'd like the app to work well on a mobile device.

The wall-clock time can be set using whatever widget is convenient for you. The durations should be a typed-in number of minutes by default (e.g. "5" means "5 minutes"), but also support "2h5m" to mean "2 hours and 5 minutes".

Each event in the list of existing events should show the event name prominently with the relative and absolute time in smaller text underneath, with edit and delete buttons (labeled with icons) on the right-hand edge.

When an event's time has come, the app should read aloud the name of the event and flash the background of the item in the list for 10 seconds.

Use local storage to remember the list of events, such that reloading the page doesn't clear any information.

A status line at the top should show the live time until the next event, and a "Clear all timers" button on the right-hand side.
